      "I was really impressed by the large number of people at the location and the long line for ordering. The atmosphere both inside and outside the store was fantastic! The staff were exceptionally nice, which made for a pleasant experience. …",
      "The best pizza I’ve tried in New York and Brooklyn! Be aware that there can be long lines at certain times of the day, especially during peak meal hours. It’s almost impossible to eat inside, but there’s a quirky bus outside where you can enjoy your slices. The pizza is incredibly delicious and flavorful—definitely worth it!",
      "Best slice in NYC on a recent trip to the city. Crust and dough was fantastic, a nice mix of NY and Napolitan pizza. Toppings were fresh, cooked to perfection. Friendly staff cool environment in the shop. Standing room only for dine in.",
      "Came here at 12pm when they opened and there’s already a line but it did move quickly. Honestly, it’s the best pizza I’ve had in NY, I’ve tried slices from all the popular places like Mama Too’s, Joe’s and Bleeker st and this is the best. Pizza is cooked perfectly and not burnt underneath. A little pricey but well worth it."

      "We stayed out in the cold on a busy Sunday in December for about 10 min to get in and let me tell you, it was worthwhile. I has their Toasted coconut chocolate croissant which was yummy. The place was filled with freshly baked goods and nice hot hot drinks which is very satisfying and soothing on a cold winter night.",
      "Everyone raves about the cronut—and while it absolutely deserves the hype, Dominique Ansel Bakery offers so much more. This was my second visit, and I love it even more than the first time. …",
      "This place is so so good. I highly recommend the treats here, not too sweet and so fresh. The wait may be a while but so worth it. I like how they have ‘treat of the day’. The hot chocolate to me was a 8/10. Macadamia cookie 10/10 macroons too. The staff is so friendly and I appreciated the seating they had in the back.",

      "My second time coming here. Attention: if you have bad day, you should come here! The staff will brighten your day (Dani the cashier, and the man in the beanie (we don’t know his name)). They were so nice and funny! The croissant and cronuts are amazing, the place is spacious."

      "The food was so fresh and good taste! It was a little difficult to read the menu if you don’t know the dishes but our server was really kind and explained everything and give us amazing suggestions! I loved the fried chicken, the sauce was insane!",
      "Wanted to give this restaurant a try due to its popularity for udon. Walked in on a Monday 5 pm therefore no wait which was great. The appetizers were my favorite rather than the udon. The tofu tasted tender and flavorful. The sushi …",
      "Been here plenty of times over the years and have always had a great time! They recently expanded and the interior with the bar at the entrance and separated booth seating right next door. …",
      "The BEST udon EVER!!! My brother, who lives in NY, brought me and my mom here for lunch. He ordered everything for us, and it was perfect! …",
      "We love Raku because of the food &amp; the people who work there.  They remember us &amp; treat us like old friends.  Thank you!",
      "Perfect location because of proximity to the Edina Theatre. Noise level was very good after families with children left. Food was fine. Not distinctive, but good. Price was a tad high for a suburban restaurant. I was annoyed that I wasn't able to receive points from OpenTable even though I reserved through that website.",

      "It took quite a while to get service....the food is amazing. The presentations are fantastic.  We shall return.",

It took another 20 minutes to get our server to take our order. She was unable to answer the most basic of questions about the menu. It appeared that everyone âworkingâ was hung over, or just sincerely disinterested in performing their duties. Maybe it was an off day, but I sure wonât be back, nor would I recommend it to anybody. The food was acceptable. Nothing outstanding.",
      "Valentine's Day - While there was a line out the door for sushi pick-up, so it must be good, our experience was a disappointment.  We ordered sushi for an appetizer, but it was so late in arriving that we did not get to try it.  It took over 30 minutes to get a drink, the food order took almost an hour and was incorrect, lukewarm and not very tasty.  Service was courteous.",

The staff is always courteous. Tables are ready and when you have a reservation, the restaurant does a great job at calling to remind you of the same. The food is impeccable. Lunch and brunch menu items vary from dinner which makes it one of those places you could easily dine at on the same day and not feel as if you're eating the same cuisine. I love how the favorites remain while other dishes change throughout the season based on availability of local vegetables, fruits and herbs.

Also had great service when making the reservation and changing the time later on, the team was very helpful. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend!",
      "10/10 experience! NYC has been missing somewhere for a Sunday roast gathering, and leave it to Jean’s to overdeliver. From the fresh oysters to start, to the Yorkshire pudding and salmon, to the sticky toffee pudding, I rarely have no notes. Make sure to order a few extra sides of the thrice fried potatoes, you can thank me later.",
      "The vibe, the food, the drinks, the service… 10/10!! Came here for a friends birthday and enjoyed every minute of it, our favorites were the lobster rolls, tuna carpaccio, burger and all the desserts. This is my new go-to spot for a fun night out or special occasions!",
      "Here's the truth: Jean's is one of the few hyped-up restaurants in NYC where the reality EXCEEDS the hype. The vibe is cozy and sexy (like, take your Raya date here but also your fun coworkers?), the staff is all good-looking and …",

Thanks all - can't wait to come back!",
      "Food was delicious but I felt like it was a tad overpriced for what it is, itâs very simple food, basic dishes, nothing groundbreaking. Ambience is great however we were sat next to two very annoying tables: one with guests that were screaming the whole time and another with guests that kept taking flash photography every 15 seconds. This was absurdly disturbing which to be fair ruined our time at the restaurant. Service was good, not great. We felt like we were being rushed to order everything and make decisions very quickly, it felt like they wanted us to get out of the table as soon as possible. Donât know if Iâll be coming back but itâs worth it going at least once just to try.",

      "Jean's feels very special from the minute you walk into the door.  It's spacious and has a great vibe.  They have some interesting food items as well as standards that are very delicious.  We enjoyed an heirloom tomato salad (a special that evening that was very flavorful).  I tried the grilled vegetables entree and the portion was substantial.  Sometimes veggie dishes can be skimpy but this was not.  The pasta pomodoro was also very nice.  I wouldn't recommend ordering the bread.  It is basically two slices of bread toasted and cut in 4 pieces.  Nothing special and not worth the price.  Besides that, everything else was fabulous.  The waitstaff was attentive and kind.    It night be fun for a celebration or a special evening out. I will definitely go back.",

      "Came in for a morning coffee the week before Christmas. Line was long and they had 2 people working. Cookies were amazing, coffee was okay.\nShop is small and in winter people cram inside to wait in the line. Doesn’t really have a vibe to it, not a coffee shop to sit and feel cozy. One to get your order and go.",
      "Visiting with friends in Autumn 2024, Culture Espresso had exceptional coffee and cookies. Staff highlighted exceptional and award winning treats that were available, and the classic chocolate chip cookie didn’t disappoint. The coffee was expertly made and flavourful. Cookie and coffee circa $10. I would recommend and visit again.",
      "First time coming here. I would come back. I got chocolate chip cookies and a vanilla latte. The place can be overwhelming due to how packed and small it is but awesome to see a place doing great! No complaints from me.",
      "FEB2025; all other ChatGPT recommendations were so so, but this one is a gem. We came for the coffee - we discovered unbelievable cookies (is that normal in the US maybe? we found that cookie just divine)"
