      "I was really impressed by the large number of people at the location and the long line for ordering. The atmosphere both inside and outside the store was fantastic! The staff were exceptionally nice, which made for a pleasant experience. …",
      "The best pizza I’ve tried in New York and Brooklyn! Be aware that there can be long lines at certain times of the day, especially during peak meal hours. It’s almost impossible to eat inside, but there’s a quirky bus outside where you can enjoy your slices. The pizza is incredibly delicious and flavorful—definitely worth it!",
      "Best slice in NYC on a recent trip to the city. Crust and dough was fantastic, a nice mix of NY and Napolitan pizza. Toppings were fresh, cooked to perfection. Friendly staff cool environment in the shop. Standing room only for dine in.",
      "Came here at 12pm when they opened and there’s already a line but it did move quickly. Honestly, it’s the best pizza I’ve had in NY, I’ve tried slices from all the popular places like Mama Too’s, Joe’s and Bleeker st and this is the best. Pizza is cooked perfectly and not burnt underneath. A little pricey but well worth it."

Servers walked by and eyed our full plates but no one stopped to ask if anything was wrong. Our server apologized but didn't offer any solutions and dropped the check.

      "Great bakery with a nice minimalist decor. No place to sit and eat so it is takeout only. Things sell out quick so get there early if there’s something you want. Everything I had was great. Would recommend!",
      "Cool spot and interior. I also love the idea of seasonal flavors and pastries. The banana banoffee pastry was spectacular!!!!  The only comment i would have is the fact that there is no seating area nor coffee, other than that it is a 10/10",
      "I visited once long time ago and remember they had nice pastry selections but with some space to improve. This time it was the same.\nIt’s a take-out place only, and staff were friendly and nice. …",
      "Supermoon Bakehouse is worth every bit of its hype. I haven’t been back for a long time, and their laminated pastries once again wowed me. At my first bite, I knew it was a real delicacy, the BEST croissant I’ve had in a while. …",

      "I love that the place is kept warm and clean. I came in while waiting for an appointment nearby and was pleasantly surprised. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and also super fast with preparing your drinks. I got a flat white and …",
      "Came in for a morning coffee the week before Christmas. Line was long and they had 2 people working. Cookies were amazing, coffee was okay.\nShop is small and in winter people cram inside to wait in the line. Doesn’t really have a vibe to it, not a coffee shop to sit and feel cozy. One to get your order and go.",
      "Visiting with friends in Autumn 2024, Culture Espresso had exceptional coffee and cookies. Staff highlighted exceptional and award winning treats that were available, and the classic chocolate chip cookie didn’t disappoint. The coffee was expertly made and flavourful. Cookie and coffee circa $10. I would recommend and visit again.",
      "First time coming here. I would come back. I got chocolate chip cookies and a vanilla latte. The place can be overwhelming due to how packed and small it is but awesome to see a place doing great! No complaints from me.",
      "FEB2025; all other ChatGPT recommendations were so so, but this one is a gem. We came for the coffee - we discovered unbelievable cookies (is that normal in the US maybe? we found that cookie just divine)"
