    "description": "Hideaway with a Prohibition-esque vibe, offering cocktails in teacups and beer in paper bags. The Back Room is one of only two speakeasies in New York City that operated during Prohibition and is still in existence today. It is a timeless example of the underbelly of New York past. The original 1920’s speakeasy, known simply as The Back of Ratner’s, played host to many theater and movie actors of the “Roaring Twenties,” as well as famous gangsters of the era. These gangsters included Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky.  They were known to use the space for business meetings. The Back Room and its history has been featured in many productions, including, HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire, New York Speakeasy Tour\" and NYC-TV‘s “Secrets of New York.“ It is this rich and authentic history that sets The Back Room apart from other “speakeasies” of today. Visit The Back Room and use the same hidden entrance that was used 85 years ago. Enjoy a cocktail from a teacup—the way people used to secretly drink during prohibition! The vintage 1920’s décor, period pieces and secret room behind the bookcase, provide the perfect setting for a date, birthday party, film shoot, event, or a casual night with friends. Although the characters may have changed, the energy and ambiance remain constant. You won’t see any gangsters, but you might be a guest at an event for Pearl Jam, Martha Stewart, Paul McCartney, New York Magazine, Robert Plant or Adele.  Experience it for yourself. Even though Prohibition is over, the tradition lives on at The Back Room!",

Servers walked by and eyed our full plates but no one stopped to ask if anything was wrong. Our server apologized but didn't offer any solutions and dropped the check.
