The glass enclosed room is beautiful with gorgeous flooring. The inside of the entire restaurant is eye catching. To take everything in is almost exhausting - it's just beautiful! The staff is always courteous. Tables are ready and when you have a reservation, the restaurant does a great job at calling to remind you of the same. The food is impeccable. Lunch and brunch menu items vary from dinner which makes it one of those places you could easily dine at on the same day and not feel as if you're eating the same cuisine. I love how the favorites remain while other dishes change throughout the season based on availability of local vegetables, fruits and herbs.

The cacio e pepe had so much black pepper that I physically had difficultly swallowing my first and only bite. Servers walked by and eyed our full plates but no one stopped to ask if anything was wrong. Our server apologized but didn't offer any solutions and dropped the check. The two entrees we barely touched should have been comped. No manager came by. At that point, our only recourse was to withhold the tip.

At C as in Charlie, Salisbury steak is served on top of GruyÃ¨re grits with a galbi jus, and baby back ribs are glazed in harissa and gochuchang. Everything on the menu here combines Korean and Southern culinary traditions in fun, creative ways.",$30 and under,"Korean, Southern, Tapas / Small Plates",5 Bleecker St,"['this restaurant is fantastic! the dishes are small so we were able to try several things and all were delicious. our server was great and super attentive to our dietary needs. we canâ\x80\x99t wait to go again :)', 'Amazing food, everything is perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. Their take on Salisbury steak and the oxbone pasta were particularly amazing. Would come back just for the oxbone pasta alone.', 'baby back ribs and pop corn chicken worth the trip', 'Very attentive and friendly service, great food, casual vibe.', 'We had a great meal! Service was thorough and warm, the food came out quickly and was all delicious and the space is really fun. Loved it!', 'Incredible. Order the mushroom bibimbap and bagel. Life changing.', 'Food was amazing at C as in Charlie -- we ordered 4 dishes and 2 desserts which was perfect for 2 people. The popcorn chicken is a must get! We also got the ribs, oxbone cream pasta and the fluke ceviche. Need to go back and try more of the menu! The service was also amazing -- very attentive and explained every dish which was very nice. We also got free sake shots which is always a plus!', ""Every bite is packed with flavor.  Unqiue dishes you can't find anywhere else.  Amazing service and everybody is super nice. And at these prices in the city!  We keep going back because it's that good."", 'Yu was an amazing waiter. She was on point and just beyond sweet. Everyone in this little, warm (in August) dining were genuinely happy to be there, as they shouldâ\x80\x99ve been.\n\nThe ribs and popcorn chicken are Korean flavored takes on classics that would easily bring folks to wait an hour at a food truck. From the first bite of the rib tapa, you know youâ\x80\x99re going to remember this dish forever.\n\nThe other stand outs were the Mushroom Bibimbap and Seoulâ\x80\x99sberry steak. Both are good looking dishes with enough familiarity to be comforting, while also being extremely unique.\n\nThis place is perfect for a lower key dinner for foodies like me. It will be by far the least expensive meal of the trip, but all of us know we found a special special spot already.', 'Food was delicious as always, service was super attentive. We love going there!']",https://www.opentable.com/r/c-as-in-charlie-new-york

True,Maison Premiere,15084,ChIJW_WGT2BZwokRNpvZ4k3lVcs,Maison Premiere,Brooklyn,"Maison Premiere serves a daily list of over 30 varieties of oysters along with an American seafood menu. Dishes include sea urchin, fresh crudo, and a selection of shared plates and entrees. The award-winning cocktail menu takes original inspiration from classic cocktails and re-imagines them as innovative, thoughtful expressions.  Inspired by New York hotel lobbies of bygone days, afternoons of leisure in Parisian cafes, and the charm of New Orleansâ Olde Absinthe House, Maison Premiere offers a truly unique dining experience.   The intimate space contains a small dining room, a horse-shoe shaped cocktail bar, and special counter seating at the oyster bar.  The full dinner menu is available at all areas of the space.  In the summer, from June to September, the lush garden provides additional seating amidst an enchanted scenery.",$31 to $50,"Seafood, American",298 Bedford Avenue,"[""Excellent neighborhood restaurant - incredible food, drinks, and service. Each time we return, even when it's years between visits, we are always impressed by Maison Premiere."", 'Outstanding value during happy hour', 'I went under special pretenses.. I was supposed to take someone there but Those plans fell apart and I took someone else. The selection of food didnâ\x80\x99t appeal to me, Iâ\x80\x99m not a seafood person. My partner enjoyed it though, which is what counts. She loved the oysters! And the drinks were great. It was very loud in there. Wasnâ\x80\x99t in the greatest of spirits but made the best of it. I doubt I would return there for the fact that the food selection I was not feeling. But if you like seafood then this is the place for you.', ""This little place is like stepping back in time in France.  We were greeted immediately and taken to a small booth in the back behind the bar.  I had mentioned in the rez that it was my mom's bday and they had a handwritten card for her on the table and then brought champagne!  Nice touch.  The oysters were amazing, the hamachi was so fresh and the scallops in brown butter....OMG.  Melted in your mouth.  We also got the lobster rolls where were delicious and had so much lobster...worth the money.  Our only thing was, being admitted wine snobs, we are spoiled in CA.  So the wine selections which are predominantly French were probably very good, we stuggled to find  a big enough cab to suit out taste.  (To each their own, we could have gotten a cocktail if we really wanted).  Either way, you MUST go here if you enjoy outstanding food and can appreciate a dimly lit little French hole-in-the-wall that isn't pretentious."", 'Perfect oyster date spot. Limited seating, so best enjoyed for a party of 2. Wide variety of oysters. Beautiful cocktails.
