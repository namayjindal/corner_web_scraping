Be aware that there can be long lines at certain times of the day, especially during peak meal hours. It’s almost impossible to eat inside, but there’s a quirky bus outside where you can enjoy your slices. The pizza is incredibly delicious and flavorful—definitely worth it!', 'Best slice in NYC on a recent trip to the city. Crust and dough was fantastic, a nice mix of NY and Napolitan pizza. Toppings were fresh, cooked to perfection. Friendly staff cool environment in the shop. Standing room only for dine in.', 'Came here at 12pm when they opened and there’s already a line but it did move quickly. Honestly, it’s the best pizza I’ve had in NY, I’ve tried slices from all the popular places like Mama Too’s, Joe’s and Bleeker st and this is the best. Pizza is cooked perfectly and not burnt underneath. A little pricey but well worth it.']",
