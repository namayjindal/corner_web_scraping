The pizza is incredibly delicious and flavorful‚Äîdefinitely worth it!', 'Best slice in NYC on a recent trip to the city. Crust and dough was fantastic, a nice mix of NY and Napolitan pizza. Toppings were fresh, cooked to perfection. Friendly staff cool environment in the shop. Standing room only for dine in.', 'Came here at 12pm when they opened and there‚Äôs already a line but it did move quickly. Honestly, it‚Äôs the best pizza I‚Äôve had in NY, I‚Äôve tried slices from all the popular places like Mama Too‚Äôs, Joe‚Äôs and Bleeker st and this is the best. Pizza is cooked perfectly and not burnt underneath. A little pricey but well worth it.']"
